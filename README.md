How to make the contact form work
The contact form sends messages to a Google Sheet. Follow these steps:

    const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById('YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID').getActiveSheet();

    sheet.appendRow([data.Name, data.Email, data.Message, new Date()]);
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({status: 'success'})).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  } catch (error) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({status: 'error', message: error.toString()})).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  }
}


Replace YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID with your Google Sheet's ID (you can find it in the URL of the sheet).
